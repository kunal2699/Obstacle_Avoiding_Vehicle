# Obstacle_Avoiding_Vehicle
The Code is written in Embedded C.
The above Arduino controller and ultrasonic sensor were studied and the HC-SR-04 ultrasonic sensor was selected, as the controlling result are satisfying for its use in the automobile prototype system bring developed. 
It was used to sense the obstacle and avoidance them. 
On successful implementation of obstacle avoidance algorithm was successfully carried out too with minimal errors, by coding the algorithm in python. 
Obstacle avoidance is a very good application to be used in vehicle preventing many accidents and loss of life.
